#### 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM:
> - The business goal is to find a model that can predict in advance whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic, history and social and economic attributes (21 Numerical and Categorical variables in Dataset)
> - Help the bank to target potential customers more effectively and improve their customer target effectiveness (Conversion Rate) and optimize the Return on Marketing     Investment (ROMI). How do we make the trade off decision on **"Revenue Maximization and Conversion Rate (Precision- Recall Tradeoff)"**
> - Over **80% Accuracy and with 70% Recall of the positive class** (converted customers to subscription) 
#### 2. APPROACH
> - This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is 'y' which indicates whether the customer has subscribed to a term deposit or not (1 - Yes, 0 - No).
> - Will be using the **Supervised Machine Learning Classification models.**
> - The model will be trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, housing loan status, personal loan status, contact communication type, last contact month of the year, number of contacts performed during this campaign, number of days since the customer was last contacted from a previous campaign, number of contacts performed before this campaign and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign.
> - Different classification models like **Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, KNN and SVM** will be used to predict the target variable
#### 3. SUCCESS CRITERION:
> Deploy the model will predict whether a customer will Subscribe to Term Deposit or not with the following success criteria: 
> - Highest **Recall (70%)** of the positive class (Y=1) while keeping **accuracy over 80%**
> - Maximizing the conversion rate (Precision) of the Marketing campaign and optimizing the Return on Marketing Investment
> - Optimizing the F1 Score (Precision-Recall Tradeoff)
#### 4. DATA PREPARATION:
> - There are 41188 records in the file: “bank-additional-full.csv”
> - There are 12 duplicate records that have to be deleted
> - **Imbalanced class distribution as there are only 12% in the positive class** (only 12% of the total customers reached subscribed to the Term Deposit)
> - Looked at 21 features (10 numerical and 11 categorical including Target variable)
> - Job, Marital, education, default, housing, loan have “Unknown Values”, so these are missing values and hence dropped from the Dataset. Dropped 10,400+ records from the dataset. Final dataset/Data frame called “Bank” has only 30478 records  
> - Dropped the “Duration” column out from the final data frame as We will never know the duration before it happens
#### 5. DATA UNDERSTANDING:
> - Most important Numerical features are:  **'previous', 'pdays', 'emp.var.rate', 'euribor3m', 'nr.employed'** and are negatively correlated to the conversion rate
> - Age, Campaign and Consumer confidence Index show extremely low correlation with the conversion rate.
> - Most important Categorical features are: **Job', 'Education', 'Default', 'Month', 'Poutcome'**
>> - "No Default" have a very significant impact on Conversion Rate
>> - "Student" and "Retired" have higher **conversion rates (over 25%)**
>> - *"Illiterate"* category have a higher **conversion rate (over 25%)** compared to other education levels
>> - **"Sept, Oct, Dec and March"** much higher **conversion rate (40% - 55%)**
>> - **"Poutcome":** Success of the previous campaign outcome leads to higher 
 **conversion rates (over 60%)**
#### 6. FEATURE ENGINEERING:
> - There are **10 Features Identified (incl. target Variable)** for building the ML models: These are *nr.employed, emp.var.rate, pdays, previous, default, job, education, poutcome, month* and Target variable (y)
> - Defined and Input Features and Target Variable
> - Created a preprocess for Scaling the Numerical features and OneHotEncoding for categorical features
> - Created a Train and Test Split of the Input features and Target Variable (Applied 25% test split and Stratify = y)
#### 7. MODELING TESTING & EVALUATION:
> - Used the Dummy Classifier to calculate the Model Accuracy and Racall: Accuracy at 87% Recall is 0%
> - Build up the Simple Model: KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM: All have a base accuracy of around 87% and Recall is just 20%
> - Did the Hyper Parameter tuning for all the models: **Accuracy in the range of 81%-82% and Recall improved significantly to 63% for all models** except KNN
> - Selected the **DECISION TREE** model as it had an **accuracy of 81%, Recall of 63% and Precision of 38%** but more importantly, its easy to communicate the non-technical audience on how the model works to identify whether a customer will subscribe to Term Deposit or Not (Target variable 1 or 0) 
> - Used the **Confusion Matrix** to show the Recall for both Positive and Negative class using all the Classification Models
#### 8. RESULTS
> - Best Model: Decision Tree: Balance between Recall, Precision and Accuracy
> - Best Parameters: {'classifier__max_depth': 5, 'classifier__min_samples_split': 10}
>>> - Training Accuracy: 0.85
>>> -	**Testing Accuracy: 0.82**
>>> - **Testing Recall: 0.63**
>>> - Testing Precision: 0.38
> - Factors that influence the Decision to Subscribe to Term Deposit:"nr.employed", "pdays", "previous", "month", "poutcome"
#### 9. DEPLOYMENT / NEXT STEPS
> - Communicate the Results of the best Model and Understand the Business context in terms of what other factors may influence the Conversion rate and get the additional data and model those features into the Data set.
> - Aim for 90% Accuracy and 80% Recall with new features included in the dataset
> - Deploy the current model (Decision Tree) working closely with The Marketing team understanding the Business objectives they would want to achieve.
> - Work with Marketing Team to share the Results and understand the Marketing Objectives:
>> - Maximize Revenue (Recall will be high but conversion rate at current levels of 12.6% reflecting through precision): Current Scenario
>> - Maximize the Marketing Investment and Revenue **(Coverage of 63% customers (Recall) and with a conversion rate of 38% (same as precision) which is 3 times the current)**
>> - Maximize the revenue and have double the conversion Rate: **Lower the threshold to 0.4, which will cover 70% customers converted (Recall of 70%) and have a conversion rate of 25% (Twice the current conversion rate of 12.6%)**
