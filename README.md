### BUSINESS PROBLEM:
> - The business goal is to find a model that can predict in advance whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic, history and social and economic attributes (21 Numerical and Categorical variables in Dataset)
> - Help the bank to target potential customers more effectively and improve their customer target effectiveness (Conversion Rate) and optimize the Return on Marketing     Investment (ROMI)
### APPROACH
> - This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is 'y' which indicates whether the customer has subscribed to a term deposit or not (1 - Yes, 0 - No).
> - Will be using the Supervised Machine Learning Classification models.
> - The model will be trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, housing loan status, personal loan status, contact communication type, last contact month of the year, number of contacts performed during this campaign, number of days since the customer was last contacted from a previous campaign, number of contacts performed before this campaign and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign.
> - Different classification models like Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, KNN and SVM will be used to predict the target variable
